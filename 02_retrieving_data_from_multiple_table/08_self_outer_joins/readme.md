## Self Outer Joins

**Introduction**

- `Self Outer Joins`, also known as self-joins with outer joins, occur when a table is joined with itself using an outer join operation.
- This technique is useful when you want to compare rows within the same table, including rows that do not have matching values.
- `Self Outer Joins` are typically used in scenarios where you need to include all rows from one instance of the table, even if there are no corresponding matches in the other instance.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.last_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

- `Customers`: The name of the table being joined with itself.
- `table1`,`table2`: Table aliases used to distinguish between the two instances of the same table.
- `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: Specifies the type of outer join to perform. You can also use `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`. 
- `Column_name`: The column(s) used to establish the join condition between the two instances of the table.


## Additional Notes:
- `Self Outer Joins` can be performed using LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, or FULL OUTER JOIN, depending on the desired result.
- Be cautious when using self outer joins, especially in tables with large numbers of rows, as they can result in a large result set.
- Ensure that the join condition is specified correctly to establish the relationship between rows within the same table.
- Test the query thoroughly to verify that the results are as expected, especially when dealing with complex hierarchical structures.
