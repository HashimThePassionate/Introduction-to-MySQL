## The IS NULL Operator

**Introduction**
- The `IS NULL Operator` is a logical operator in SQL used to test whether a column contains a NULL value.
- It allows you to filter rows based on the absence of a value in a particular column.

## Syntax
  ```sql
 SELECT * 
 FROM customers 
 WHERE phone IS NULL;
 ```
- `Phone`: The column to be tested for NULL values.

## Additional Notes
- The `IS NULL Operator` returns true if the specified column contains a NULL value, and false otherwise.
- It is important to use the IS NULL operator rather than equality operators (=, <>) when testing for NULL values, as NULL is not equal 
  to any value, including NULL itself.
