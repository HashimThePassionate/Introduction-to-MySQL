## The Cross Joins

**Introduction**

- `Cross Joins`, also known as Cartesian joins, are a type of join operation in SQL that produces the Cartesian product of two or more tables. 
- In other words, it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table, resulting in a new table with a number of rows equal to the product of the number of rows in each table. 
- `Cross Joins` can be useful in scenarios where you need to generate combinations of rows from different tables, but they should be used judiciously as they can quickly generate large result sets. 

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT 
c.first_name AS customer,
p.name AS product 
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN sql_store.products p 
ORDER BY c.first_name;
```

- `Customers`, `Products`: The tables being cross-joined. You can cross-join more than two tables by adding additional table names separated by commas.
- `first_name`,`name`: The columns you want to select from the resulting Cartesian product.

- Combine every record from first table to second table.
- WE combine every record from customer table to products table.

## Additional Notes:
- `Cross Joins` should be used with caution, especially when joining tables with a large number of rows, as they can quickly generate a large Cartesian product.
- Always consider the potential size of the result set when using `Cross Joins` and ensure that it is manageable.
- `Cross Joins` are often used in combination with filtering conditions (e.g., WHERE clause) to limit the size of the result set to only the desired combinations.
- Avoid using `Cross Joins` when more specific join conditions (e.g., based on common columns) are appropriate, as they may produce unintended or inefficient results.
