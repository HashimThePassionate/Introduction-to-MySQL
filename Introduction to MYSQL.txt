### How to Select Database
```sql
### How to Select Database
 USE <Dbname> || use <Dbname>
USE mydb || use mydb
```

### How to Select all Table fields in Database using "*" 
- First Select Database
- Select table
- Also use semicolon ; at the end of each statement

```sql
USE mydb;
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

### How to Select and filter a specific row using WHERE Clause
```sql
USE mydb;
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

### How to Select Table and sort using First_name with ORDER BY Clause
```sql
USE mydb;
SELECT * 
FROM customers
-- WHERE customer_id = 5  "--" Double Hyphen is used to comment something
ORDER BY first_name;

```
### How to Select a specific fields with field name
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points FROM customers;
```

### How to Select a specific fields with field name and calculate something in run time
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points, points+10 FROM customers;

```
### Select specific field and calculate something but change calculated name in run time with AS Alias
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points, (points+10)*100 AS discount_factor FROM customers;
```

### if you want to add Space in Alias name
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name , points, (points+10)*100 AS 'Discount Factor' FROM customers;
```

### How to select only unique and non duplicate value 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;
```
- Make sure if you use SELECT DISTINCT first_name, city FROM customer it means both first_name and city
must be distinct.
- It does not mean that only the city column should be distinct.


### How to filter with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points>1500;
``` 
- filter those records whose points are greater than 1500
- Also you should use these operators >,<,>=,<=,!=, <> 

### How to filter string matched record with WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'karachi'; 
```

### How to filter those records which does not contain string 'karachi'
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city != 'karachi'; 
or 
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city <> 'karachi';
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > '2023-08-07'
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07';
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 and Points > 1500
- We use AND operator it return true if both condition meets true
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07' AND points > 1500;
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR Points > 1500
- We use OR operator it return true if at least one  condition meets true
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR points > 1500;
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 is NOT Greater than 
- We use NOT operator to reverse
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE NOT(birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR points > 1500);
```

### How to filter those records whose birth_date > 2023-08-07 OR Points > 1500 AND city ="kohat"
- We use OR and AND both to add multiple conditions
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE birth_date > '2023-08-07' OR (points > 1500 AND city = 'kohat');
```

### How to select those result whose city is kohat or karachi
- We use IN operator, we can also use OR operator but IN operator is shorter and it works like OR operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city IN ('karachi','kohat');

```
### How to select those result whose city is not in kohat or karachi
- We use NOT IN operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city NOT IN ('karachi','kohat');
```

### How to select those points >= 1000 and <= 1500
- We use BETWEEN operator, note we can also use >=  <= operators but BETWEEN is shorter
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 1500;
```

### How to select those rows that matched with specific string pattern using LIKE operator
- we use WHERE last_name LIKE 's%' it means last_name must be start with s but after s it contain any letters.
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE 's%';
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE 'summer%'; //start with summer ends with any letter
```

### change the pattern in LIKE operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '%s';// start with any  letter but ends with s
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '%s%';// start with any  letter and ends with any letter but s letter can be any
where
```

### Use underscore to define how many letters end with that pattern
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '_______s'
```

### we can also specify first and last letter and Between letters range with "__"  underscore
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE 'v______s'
```

### use  REGEXP to use complex string pattern
- Look we use like operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name LIKE '%hr%'
```
- we can also use REGEXP for more complex string patterns
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP 'hr'
```
### first_name must start with hr
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name LIKE '%hr%'
```
- we can also use REGEXP for more complex string patterns
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name REGEXP 'hr'
```
### first_name must start with hr
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP '^hr'
```

### first_name must end with t
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP 't$'
```

### we can also use pipe operator | in REGEXP
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP '^ch|t$'
```
- it means first_name must start with ch 
- Or first_name must end with t


### we can also specify []
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP '[agc]t'
```
- first_name will be at, gt, ct anywhere

### we can change pattern
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP 't[agc]'
```
- first_name will be ta, tg, tc anywhere

### we can also specify range [a-h]
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE first_name REGEXP '[a-h]t'
```
- first_name will be at,bt,ct,dt,et,ft, gt, ht anywhere

### How to select those records whone phone no is NULL using "IS NULL" operator
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone IS NULL;
```
### How to select and sort data by column name 
- by default every column is sorted according  to primary key column
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER by first_name;
```
### We can also sort by multiple columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER by first_name;
```
### We can also sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM customer ORDER by first_name, last_name;
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER by first_name DESC, last_name ASC;
```

### How  to Select first 10 records using "LIMIT" Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;
```

### How to skip  first 10 records using "LIMIT" Clause and select 3 records before 10 records
- we define offset 10 , 3
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10 , 3;
```

### Reterieve Random record with RAND Function
- Please use ORDER By Clause otherwise you got an error
```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;
```
### How to select one table with relationship to another table using "INNER JOIN"
- lets we have orders table in orders table we have customer_id which is a foriegn key to customer table
-  In Orders table we have  orders_id, customer_id, status, comments
- In Customer table we have customer_id, first_name, last_name, birth_date, phone, address, city and state
- We want to inner join with orders table and customer table
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders INNER JOIN customerON orders.customer_id  = customer.customer_id;
```

### We can also achieve "INNER JOIN" with implicit Syntax
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id  = c.customer_id;
```

### How to find only select first_name, city and phone from customer table 
```sql
SELECT order_id, orders.customer_id first_name, phone, city 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN customers
ON 
orders.customer_id  = customer.customer_id;

```
### We can also use alias in inner join
```sql
SELECT order_id, o.customer_id first_name, phone, city 
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
ON 
o.customer_id  = c.customer_id;
```

### We to join tables across Databases 
- suppose we have a Database name inventory
- In the inventory db we have products table
- this product table is associated with orders_items 
- we can easily join using db.table name
```sql
select * 
FROM orders_items oi
INNER JOIN inventory.products p
ON
oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```

### How to select only selected name, quantity from products table 
```sql
select oi.product_id, unit_price, name
FROM orders_items oi
INNER JOIN inventory.products p
ON
oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```
### How to Select Self join table itself 
- Suppose we have employe table we want to check who is manager in our complany
- But the best thing is manager is itself an employe of this complany
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees m
JOIN employees e
ON
 e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
```

### How to Select Self join table itself 
- only want to check the manager
```sql
SELECT 
e.employee_id,
e.first_name,
m.first_name as Manager
FROM employees m
JOIN employees e
ON
 e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
```

### How to JOIN multiple tables
- We have three tables orders, order_status and customer we want to join
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
ON
o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_status os
ON os.status_is = o.status;
```
### Lets Extract Beautifully
```sql
SELECT 
o.order_id,
o.order_date,
c.first_name,
c.last_name,
os.name AS Status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
ON
o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_status os
ON os.status_is = o.status;
```
### Left Join
- Left outer join select those records which are not
- like in our example we also select those customers who don't have any order as well as who do
```sql
SELECT 
c.customer_id, 
c.first_name, 
o.order_id 
FROM customers c 
LEFT JOIN orders o 
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
ORDER BY c.customer_id 

```
### Right Join
- Right outer join select those records which satisfy the condition
- like in our example we only select those customers who have orders
```sql
SELECT 
c.customer_id, 
c.first_name, 
o.order_id 
FROM customers c 
LEFT JOIN orders o 
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
ORDER BY c.customer_id 
```

### USING Clause
- USING Clause can replace JOIN complex steps
- But it can only work when both table have same column name
```sql
SELECT 
o.order_id,
c.first_name
FROM orders o 
JOIN customers c
-- ON o.customer_id = c.first_name
USING (customer_id);
```


### Cross JOIN
- combine every record from first table to second table
- WE combine every record from customer table to products table
```sql
SELECT 
c.first_name AS customer,
p.name AS product 
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN inventory.products p 
ORDER BY c.first_name;
```

### Combine tables rows with UNION
```sql
SELECT 
order_id,
order_date,
'Active' AS status
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2023-11-09'
UNION
SELECT 
order_id,
order_date,
'Archived' AS status
FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2023-11-09'
```

### INSERT RECORDS
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    birth_date,
    phone,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    points
) VALUES (
    52,
    'Ahmed',
    'Raheem',
    NULL,
    NULL,
    'Azad Chaiwala Institute',
    'Rawalpindi',
    'Punjab',
    DEFAULT
);
```

### INSERT Multiple RECORD
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    birth_date,
    phone,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    points
) VALUES (
    53,
    'Ishaque',
    'Chaiwala',
    NULL,
    NULL,
    'Azad Chaiwala Institute',
    'Rawalpindi',
    'Sindh',
    DEFAULT
),
(
    54,
    'Muhammad',
    'Mowahid',
    NULL,
    NULL,
    'Azad Chaiwala Institute',
    'Rawalpindi',
    'Punjab',
    DEFAULT
);

```
### INSERT Hierarchical RECORDS
```sql
INSERT INTO customers(customer_id,first_name,last_name,birth_date)
VALUES (DEFAULT,'IGI','ORIGIN','2023-12-25');

INSERT INTO orders(order_id,order_date, status,customer_id)
VALUES(DEFAULT,'2023-12-25',1,LAST_INSERT_ID());

INSERT INTO
orders_items(order_id,product_id,unit_price,quantity)
VALUES (LAST_INSERT_ID(),9,35,3);

```
### Creating Copy of a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_archived  AS
SELECT * FROM orders;
```


### Creating only data from one table to another
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_archived  AS
SELECT * from orders WHERE order_date > '2023-12-01';
```

### Updating Single Record
```sql
UPDATE customers 
SET first_name="Muhammad", last_name="Hashim", birth_date="2023-12-30"
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```
### Using subqueries in Update
```sql
UPDATE orders
SET comments = "Gold Customer"
WHERE c_id IN
                (SELECT customer_id
                 FROM customers
                 WHERE points > 1800);

```

### Using subqueries in Delete
```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE c_id = (
			SELECT customer_id
			FROM customers
			WHERE first_name = "Delano"
			 );

```

### Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
MAX(salary) AS Highest,
MIN(salary) AS lowest,
AVG(salary) AS average,
SUM(salary) AS total,
COUNT(salary) AS number_of_records
FROM employees;

```
### The GROUP By Clause in Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
client_id,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

### The GROUP By Clause with WHERE Clause in Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
client_id,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= '2019-07-01'
GROUP BY client_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
### The GROUP By Clause with inner JOIN in Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
name,
state,
city,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients c USING(client_id)
GROUP BY state, city;

```
### The GROUP By Clause with inner JOIN in Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT date,
pm.name,
SUM(amount) AS total_amounts
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
### Having Clause with Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
client_id,
COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING total_sales > 500;

```

### Having Clause with Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT 
client_id,
COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING total_sales > 500 AND number_of_invoices > 5;


```
### Aggregate functions WITH ROLLUP
```sql
SELECT 
client_id,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id WITH ROLLUP;
```
### Aggregate functions WITH ROLLUP and JOIN
```sql
SELECT 
state,
city,
SUM(invoice_total) as total_sales
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients c USING(client_id)
GROUP BY state, city WITH ROLLUP;
```

### Write more about subqueries
- expensive than lettuce (id = 3)
- MySQL first execute innersubquery than pass it to out query
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE unit_price > (
SELECT unit_price
FROM products
WHERE product_id = 3
);
```
### Write more about subqueries
- In Sql_hr database
- find employees who earn more than average 
```sql
SELECT * FROM
employees WHERE salary > (
SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
);
```
### Write more about subqueries using IN operator
- find that product that have never been ordered 
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT product_id
FROM order_items
);
```
### Write more about subqueries using IN operator
- find clients without invoices
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM clients 
WHERE client_id NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT client_id
FROM invoices
);
```
## join vs sub query
### using subqueries
- find customer who have ordered lettuce
- select customer_id , first_name, last_name
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
first_name,
last_name
FROM customers 
WHERE customer_id IN(
SELECT o.customer_id   
FROM order_items oi
JOIN orders o USING (order_id)
    WHERE product_id = 3
);
```
### using JOIN
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
first_name,
last_name
FROM customers c 
JOIN orders o USING(customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi USING(order_id)
WHERE oi.product_id = 3;
```
### without ALL keyword
- select invoices larger than all invoices of client 3
```sql
SELECT *
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoice_total >(
SELECT MAX(invoice_total)
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = 3 
);
```
### ALL keyword
```sql
SELECT *
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoice_total > ALL(
SELECT invoice_total
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = 3 
);
```
### Correlated subqueries
- For each employe
- calculate the avg salary for employee.office
- return the employee if salary > avg
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
WHERE salary > (
	SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees 
    WHERE office_id = e.office_id
);

```
### The EXISTS operator
- Select client that have an invoice

- one method 
```sql
Select *
FROM clients
WHERE client_id IN (
    select DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices
);
```
- second method
```sql
SELECT *
FROM clients
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices
) AS distinct_clients
ON clients.client_id = distinct_clients.client_id;
```
- third method
```sql
Select *
FROM clients c
WHERE EXISTS (
    select client_id
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = c.client_id
);
```
### Date Functions to check dynamically current Year orders
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW());
```
### FORMAT_DATE Function
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date,'%D %M %Y')
FROM orders;
```
### ADDING DATE Function
```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
FROM orders;
```
### IFNULL Function
```sql
SELECT 
order_id,
shipper_id
FROM orders;

SELECT 
order_id,
IFNULL(shipper_id,'Not Assigned') AS shipper
FROM orders;
```
### COALESCE Function
```sql
SELECT 
order_id,
COALESCE(shipper_id,comments,'Not Assigned') AS shipper
FROM orders;

SELECT 
order_id,
IFNULL(shipper_id,'...') AS shipperID,
COALESCE(shipper_id,comments,'Not Assigned') AS shipper
FROM orders;
```
### IF Function
```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_date,
    IF(YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()), 'Active', 'Archived') AS order_status
FROM orders;
```

### CASE  Operator
```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,
    CASE
    WHEN YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()) THEN 'Active'
    WHEN YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(NOW()) - 1 THEN 'Last Year'
    WHEN YEAR(order_date) < YEAR(NOW()) - 1 THEN 'Archived'
    ELSE 'Future'
    END AS Category
FROM orders;
```

### Practice
```sql
SELECT 
CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS Customer,
points,
CASE
	WHEN points > 3000 THEN 'Gold Customer'
    WHEN points >= 2000 THEN 'Silver Customer'
	ELSE 'Bronze Customer'
    END AS category
FROM customers;
```
### Creating View
```sql
CREATE VIEW sales_by_client AS 
SELECT 
c.client_id,
c.name,
SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING(client_id)
GROUP BY client_id, name;
```
### Drop View
```sql
DROP VIEW invoices_with_balance;
```
### Updatable View
- DISTINCT
- Aggregate functions (MIN , MAX, SUM) etc
- GROUP BY / HAVING
- UNION
- If we dont have these in mention above
- than our view is Updatable view
``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
	SELECT 
	invoice_id,
	number,
	client_id,
	invoice_total,
	payment_total,
	invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
	invoice_date,
	payment_date,
	due_date
	FROM invoices
    WHERE (invoice_total-payment_total) > 0;

DELETE FROM invoices_with_balance
WHERE invoice_id = 1;
```
- prevent view as only read-only 
- add WITH check OPTION;
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
	SELECT 
	invoice_id,
	number,
	client_id,
	invoice_total,
	payment_total,
	invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
	invoice_date,
	payment_date,
	due_date
	FROM invoices
    WHERE (invoice_total-payment_total) > 0
    WITH check OPTION;

```

### Output Parameters  in  Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_unpaid_invoices_for_clients
	(
      client_id INT   
        )
BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(*) ,
    SUM(invoice_total)
    FROM invoices i
    WHERE i.client_id =  client_id
    	AND payment_total = 0;
END$$
DELIMITER ;

CALL get_unpaid_invoices_for_clients(3);
```
- we get this
```sql
-----------------------------------
|   COUNT(*)   SUM(invoice_total) |
|   2          286.08             |
-----------------------------------
```
- We can also recieves these values through Parameters 2, 286.08
- we can specific OUT to identify Output Parameters
- also copy this using INTO
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_unpaid_invoices_for_clients
	(
      client_id INT,
      OUT invoices_count INT,
      OUT invoices_total DECIMAL(9,2)
	)
BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(invoice_total)
    INTO invoices_count, invoices_total
    FROM invoices i
    WHERE i.client_id =  client_id
    	AND payment_total = 0;
END$$
DELIMITER ;

CALL get_unpaid_invoices_for_clients(3)
```
- we get some output Parameters in the form of variables which is hard to read
- sometime we avoid
```sql
SET @p0='3'; SET @p1=''; SET @p2=''; 
CALL `get_unpaid_invoices_for_clients`(@p0, @p1, @p2); 
SELECT @p1 AS `invoices_count`, @p2 AS `invoices_total`;
```
```sql
-----------------------------------
|   COUNT(*)   SUM(invoice_total) |
|   2          286.08             |
-----------------------------------
```
### Local variables  in  Procedure
- risk_factor = invoices_total / invoices_count * 5
- these are all local variables
- we get data from table and pass these data to local variables finally we select
- local variables will die when procedure were finished
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_risk_factor()
BEGIN
    DECLARE risk_factor DECIMAL(9,2) DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE invoices_total DECIMAL(9,2);
    DECLARE invoices_count INT;
	SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(invoice_total)
    INTO invoices_count, invoices_total
    FROM invoices;
    SET risk_factor = invoices_total / invoices_count * 5;
    SELECT risk_factor;
END$$
DELIMITER ;

CALL get_risk_factor();

### TRANSACTIONS
- A group of sql statements that
- represent a Single unit of work
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders(customer_id,order_date,status)
VALUES(1,'2024-01-09',1);
INSERT INTO order_items()
VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),1,1,1);
COMMIT;
```
### Concurrency and dead locking
- run this script line by line in to different script box 
- query box 1
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers
SET points = points + 10
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
- query box 2
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers
SET points = points + 10
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
### TRANSACTION Isolation
```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'transaction_isolation';
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```
## READ UNCOMMITTED Isolation level
### Dirty Read Transactions

- Session 1
```sql
USE sql_store; --1
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED; --2
select points -- 6 Read UNCOMMITTED data 
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```
- Session 2
```sql
Use  sql_store; -- 3
START TRANSACTION; -- 4
Update customers -- 5
SET points = 20
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;

```
### READ COMMITTED Isolation level
- Session 1
```sql
USE sql_store;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; -- 1
START TRANSACTION; -- 2
select points  FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1; -- 3
select points  FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1; -- 6
COMMIT; -- *
```
- Session 2
```sql
Use  sql_store;
START TRANSACTION; 
Update customers 
SET points = 30 -- 4
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT; -- 5
```
### REPEATABLE READ Isolation Level
- Session 1
```sql
USE sql_store;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; -- 1
START TRANSACTION; -- 2
select points  FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1; -- 3
select points  FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1; -- 5
COMMIT;
```
- Session 2
```sql
Use  sql_store;
START TRANSACTION; 
Update customers 
SET points = 30 
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT; -- 4
```

- in this Isolation we see phanton Read problem
```sql
USE sql_store;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
START TRANSACTION; -- 1 
select *  FROM customers WHERE state = 'VA'; -- we give a special discount -- 3 -- 5
COMMIT;
```
- Session 2
```sql
Use  sql_store;
START TRANSACTION; 
Update customers -- 2
SET state = 'VA'
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT; -- 4
```

```sql
USE sql_store;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- 1
START TRANSACTION; -- 2
select *  FROM customers WHERE state = 'VA'; -- 5
COMMIT;
```
- Session 2
```sql
Use  sql_store;
START TRANSACTION; -- 3
Update customers -- 4
SET state = 'VA'
WHERE customer_id = 3;

### MYSQL Datatypes
1. String datatypes
2. Integer datatypes
3. Fixed point and Floating datatypes
4. Boolean datatypes
5. Enum and Set types datatypes -- we avoid to use this datatypes
6. Date and Time types datatypes
7. Blob datatypes --we also avoid to use binary data bcz its slow down our database backup
8. JSON datatypes

### String Datatypes
- CHAR(x)  -- fixed-length like abbreviation of state 'VA'
- VARCHAR(x) -- variable-length like storing usernames, passwords, email addresses and so on

- Recommended 
- VARCHAR(50)   for short strings like usernames and passwords
- VARCHAR(255)  for medium-length strings like addresses

- Maximum Length
```sql
- CHAR(x)     --  
- VARCHAR(x)  -- max : 65,535 characters (64KB) 
- MEDIUMTEXT  -- max : 16MB              16,777,216    characters --JSON objects, CSV and short medium length book

### What are Indexes?
Indexes are special data structures associated with MySQL tables that significantly accelerate data retrieval operations. They function like an organized filing system, enabling the database to locate specific rows efficiently.

### Importance of Indexes in Relational Databases
Relational databases store massive amounts of data, often organized into tables with numerous columns. When you execute a query that filters or retrieves data based on particular values, MySQL must scan the entire table by default. This can become extremely slow, especially for large datasets.

Indexes come to the rescue by providing a sorted and structured representation of specific columns. When a query references indexed columns, MySQL can leverage these indexes to quickly pinpoint the relevant data blocks, leading to a dramatic performance boost.

### Data Structures for Fast Querying
MySQL primarily employs Binary-Tree data structures to implement indexes. B-Trees are self-balancing search trees optimized for fast searches and insertions. They resemble a hierarchical index card system, where each level guides the search towards the target data:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashimThePassionate/Introduction-to-MySQL/main/images/B_Tree.png" alt="Binary Search Tree" width="100%">

-   **Root Node:** The topmost level, containing pointers to the most selective child nodes.
-   **Intermediate Nodes:** Each intermediate node holds references to its child nodes, further narrowing down the search based on indexed column values.
-   **Leaf Nodes:** The bottommost level, where actual data row pointers or the data rows themselves are stored.

####    Benefits of Using Indexes:
-   **Enhanced Query Performance:** Indexes significantly accelerate SELECT queries filtering or sorting based on indexed columns.
-   **Improved Efficiency of JOINs:** Indexes can optimize JOIN operations when involved columns are indexed.
-   **Enforced Uniqueness (Unique Indexes):** Unique indexes guarantee that no duplicate values exist in a column, ensuring data integrity.
-   **Faster ORDER BY Operations:** Sorting operations can leverage indexes to efficiently order results based on indexed columns.

##  Disadvantages of Indexes:
**Increased Storage Space:**
*   Indexes require additional disk space to store the sorted data structures. This additional space can be a small percentage of the actual table size, but it's a factor to keep in mind, especially for very large tables.
*   The space consumption is particularly noticeable for string-based indexes, as they need to store both the string value and its length.
**Slower Write Operations:**
*   When you perform INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations, the database needs to update the indexes in addition to modifying the actual table data. This can introduce a slight performance overhead for write-heavy workloads.

**Helpfull Suggestion in indexes:**
*   Analyze query patterns: Focus on indexing columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or ORDER BY clauses.
*   Balance read vs. write performance: If your workload is mostly read-heavy, the benefits of faster queries may outweigh the slowdown for write operations.
*   Monitor and adjust: As your database grows and query patterns evolve, review indexing strategies and adjust them for optimal performance.


### Example Query (Before Indexing):
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customer where state = 'CA';
```
Now look to find the customer whose state is CA, mysql reads all the records
we can see using **Explain** keyword before select statement...

#### Now lets Create Indexe for fast searching:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_state ON customer (state);
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customer where state = 'CA';
```

### Viewing Indexes:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_state ON customers (state);
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customer where state = 'CA';
```

### Prefix Indexes:
In MySQL, a prefix index is an index type that indexes only a portion of a column's values rather than the entire value. This can be particularly useful when indexing columns with long string values, such as VARCHAR or TEXT columns, where indexing the entire value might not be necessary or efficient.

By specifying a prefix length when creating an index on a column, MySQL will only index the specified number of characters from the beginning of each value in that column. This can save disk space and improve query performance, especially for columns with long values where indexing the entire value would be unnecessary.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sql_inventory.customer;
USE sql_inventory;
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON customer(last_name(20));
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 1)) ,
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 5)) ,
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 10)) ,
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 20)) 
FROM customer;
```
1.   **CREATE INDEX:** 
*   The first statement **CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON customer(last_name(20))** creates an index named **idx_last_name** on the last_name column of the **customer** table.
*   The **(20)** part specifies that the index will only consider the first 20 characters of the **last_name** for indexing. This creates a prefix index.
2.   **SELECT STATEMENT:** 
*   The second statement is a **SELECT** query that retrieves three counts from the **customer** table.
*   It uses the **COUNT(DISTINCT ...)** function four times to count the number of distinct values for different prefixes of the **last_name** column.
*   **Specifically, it counts:**
    1.  **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 1))** counts the number of distinct values considering only the first character of the **last_name** column.
    2.   **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 5))** counts the number of distinct values considering only the first five characters of the **last_name** column.
    3.   **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 10))** counts the number of distinct values considering only the first ten characters of the **last_name** column.
    4.   **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 20))** The number of distinct values considering the entire last_name (up to 20 characters).


## FULL TEXT SEARCH:
A full-text index is a special type of index used in database systems to enable efficient searching of text within large columns of textual data, such as VARCHAR or TEXT columns. Unlike traditional indexes that work well for exact matches or range queries, full-text indexes are optimized for natural language search queries where users might search for words or phrases within a text.
```sql
USE sql_blog;
SELECT * FROM posts;
```
*   Lets look we want to search 'react redux' in post and title field how can we do?
```sql
USE sql_blog;
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE title LIKE '%react redux%' OR body LIKE '%react redux%';
```
*   Is it works? nope
lets create full text indexes and then search
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_title_body ON posts (title,body);
```
Now search react and redux
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM posts 
WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('react redux');

SELECT * 
FROM posts 
WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('react -redux' IN BOOLEAN MODE);

SELECT * 
FROM posts 
WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('react -redux +Form' IN BOOLEAN MODE);

SELECT * 
FROM posts 
WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('handling a form, IN BOOLEAN MODE');
```
##  Composite Index:

A composite index, also known as a compound index, is an index created on multiple columns in a database table. Unlike a single-column index that indexes values from a single column, a composite index indexes values from multiple columns concatenated together. This allows queries to efficiently filter, sort, and search based on combinations of values from these columns

```sql
use sql_store;
CREATE INDEX id_points ON customers(points);
SHOW INDEXES IN customers;
CREATE INDEX idx_state_points ON customers (state,points);
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customers
WHERE state = 'CA' and points> 1000;
DROP INDEX idx_state_points ON customers;
```

## Order of Composite:
**Two rules of composite indexes:**
1. Put the most frequently used columns first 
2. Put the columns with a higher cardinality first cardinality means unique values
```sql
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers WHERE state = 'CA' 
AND last_name LIKE 'A%';
```
To Count how many unique values in each column 
```sql
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT state), 
COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) 
FROM customers;
```
lets First we follow cardinality Rule **Note** cardinality rule not always work
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname_state ON customers (last_name, state); --Create index if not created
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE state = 'CA' 
AND 
last_name LIKE 'A%';
```
Now we reverse the order we put state than last_name
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_state_lastname ON customers (state,last_name); --Create index if not created
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE state = 'CA' 
AND 
last_name LIKE 'A%';
```
To force mysql to use different index we use
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
USE INDEX (idex_lastname_state) 
WHERE state = 'CA' 
AND 
last_name LIKE 'A%';
```

##  When indexes are ignored??:
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE state = 'CA' 
OR 
points > 1000;
```
How to optimize this query? lets create a separte index and than apply union
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_points ON customers(points);
```
Now apply again:
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE state = 'CA' 
UNION 
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE points > 1000;
```
Another Example:
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE points + 10 > 2010;
```
This is searching FULL indexes so to fix,
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
WHERE points > 2000;
```

##  Using Indexes For Sorting:
lets check the indexes and then sort by ASC
```sql
SHOW INDEXES IN customers;
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY state; 
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'last_query_cost';
```
Lets check the cost of previous query!

Now lets check first_name which is not in indexes
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY first_name; 
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'last_query_cost';
```
Why cost is so high? because first_name is not indexes, when we put a column in indexes, mysql will automatically sort it in ASC and store it parmanent.
Now first_name is not in indexes so why mysql find? mysql uses filesort algorithm  which is very expensive.
**Here's how it works:**
*   Query Execution: When a query is executed, MySQL first retrieves the rows that match the WHERE clause.
*   Sorting: If the query has an ORDER BY clause and there's no suitable index to perform the sorting efficiently, MySQL resorts to the filesort algorithm. It sorts the result set based on the specified columns.
*   Temporary File: As MySQL sorts the result set, it may need to write intermediate results to a temporary file on disk if the result set is too large to fit into memory. This temporary file is used to store portions of the result set that can't be held in memory at once.
*   Merging: Once all the rows are sorted and stored in the temporary file, MySQL performs a merge operation to combine the sorted portions into a single sorted result set.
*   Final Result: After merging, MySQL returns the sorted result set to the client.
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY state , points DESC; 
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'last_query_cost';
```
Why cost decreases again? because both were in indexes.
```sql
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY state ,first_name, points; 
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'last_query_cost';

-- --------------------------------------------------------
EXPLAIN 
SELECT customer_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY state DESC , points DESC; 
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'last_query_cost';
```
## Creating A User
To create a user in MySQL, you can use the CREATE USER statement. Here's a basic example of how to 
```sql
    CREATE USER 'hashim'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '*******';
```

This command creates a user with the username 'username' and password 'password', and allows connections only from the local machine ('localhost'). If you want to allow connections for specific

```sql
    CREATE USER hashim@codewithhashim.com IDENTIFIED BY '*********************';
```

for subdomain
```sql
    CREATE USER hashim@'%codewithhashim.com' IDENTIFIED BY '*********************';
```

For simplicity we can sue
```sql
    CREATE USER hashim IDENTIFIED BY '*******';
```

## Viewing A User:
```sql
    SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
```

## Dropping A User:
```sql
    DROP USER hashim
```

## Changing Password For A User:
```sql
    SET PASSWORD FOR hashim = '*************';
```

## Changing Password For Current Login User:
```sql
    SET PASSWORD  = '*************';
```

##  Lets Create A New User And Grant privileges:
```sql
    CREATE USER farooq IDENTIFIED BY '******'
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT 
    ON sql_store.*
    To farooq
```
For Admin
```sql
    GRANT ALL ON *.*
    TO farooq
```
