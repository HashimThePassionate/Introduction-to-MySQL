### Deleting Single Row

- Deleting a single row in a database removes that specific record from the table. It's a straightforward operation, typically done using the `DELETE FROM` statement in SQL.

- Here's the basic syntax for deleting a single row in SQL:-

```sql
USE sql_store;
DELETE 
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 52;
```

* `table_name`: The name of the table from which you want to delete the row.
* `WHERE condition`: The condition that identifies the row to be deleted. If omitted, all rows in the table will be deleted.

- It's important to use caution when deleting rows from a database, especially without specifying a condition. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, it will delete all rows from the table, which can lead to data loss if not intended. Always double-check your conditions before executing a delete operation to avoid unintended consequences.
