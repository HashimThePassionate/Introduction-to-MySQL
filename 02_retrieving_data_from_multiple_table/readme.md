## OVERVIEW

- `Retrieving data` from multiple tables is a fundamental operation in relational databases, often accomplished using SQL JOIN operations.


## Using JOINS:
To retrieve data from multiple tables, SQL uses JOIN operations. The most common types of JOINs are:

- `INNER JOIN`: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table (first table specified) and matching rows from the right table.
- `RIGHT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

- `Retrieving data from multiple tables` allows you to access and analyze related information efficiently. Understanding the database schema, relationships, and how to use JOIN operations effectively are key skills in working with relational databases.
