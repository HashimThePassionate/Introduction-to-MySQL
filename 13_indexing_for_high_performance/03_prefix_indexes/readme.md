### Prefix Indexes:
In MySQL, a prefix index is an index type that indexes only a portion of a column's values rather than the entire value. This can be particularly useful when indexing columns with long string values, such as VARCHAR or TEXT columns, where indexing the entire value might not be necessary or efficient.

By specifying a prefix length when creating an index on a column, MySQL will only index the specified number of characters from the beginning of each value in that column. This can save disk space and improve query performance, especially for columns with long values where indexing the entire value would be unnecessary.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sql_inventory.customer;
USE sql_inventory;
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON customer(last_name(20));
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 1)) ,
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 5)) ,
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 10)) ,
  COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 20)) 
FROM customer;
```
1.   **CREATE INDEX:** 
*   The first statement **CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON customer(last_name(20))** creates an index named **idx_last_name** on the last_name column of the **customer** table.
*   The **(20)** part specifies that the index will only consider the first 20 characters of the **last_name** for indexing. This creates a prefix index.
2.   **SELECT STATEMENT:** 
*   The second statement is a **SELECT** query that retrieves three counts from the **customer** table.
*   It uses the **COUNT(DISTINCT ...)** function four times to count the number of distinct values for different prefixes of the **last_name** column.
*   **Specifically, it counts:**
    1.  **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 1))** counts the number of distinct values considering only the first character of the **last_name** column.
    2.   **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 5))** counts the number of distinct values considering only the first five characters of the **last_name** column.
    3.   **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 10))** counts the number of distinct values considering only the first ten characters of the **last_name** column.
    4.   **COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 20))** The number of distinct values considering the entire last_name (up to 20 characters).
