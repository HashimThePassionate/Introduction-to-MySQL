# Correlated Subqueries in MySQL

## Overview

Welcome to the documentation on correlated subqueries in MySQL! Correlated subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to reference columns from the outer query within the subquery. This guide will explain what correlated subqueries are, how they work, and how you can use them effectively in your MySQL queries.


## What are Correlated Subqueries?

A correlated subquery, also known as a synchronized subquery, is a subquery that references one or more columns from the outer query. Unlike non-correlated subqueries, which can be executed independently of the outer query, correlated subqueries are executed for each row processed by the outer query.


## Syntax
The syntax for a correlated subquery in MySQL is as follows:

```sql

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name outer_table
WHERE condition_operator (
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM inner_table
    WHERE inner_table.column_name = outer_table.column_name
);
```
Here, the condition_operator can be any comparison operator such as =, >, <, >=, <=, or <>.


## Example

* For each employe
* calculate the avg salary for employee.office
* return the employee if salary > avg

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
WHERE salary > (
	SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees 
    WHERE office_id = e.office_id
);
```


## Benefits of Correlated Subqueries

* **Dynamic Filtering**: Correlated subqueries allow for dynamic filtering based on values from the outer query, enabling more complex and precise data retrieval.
* **Simplicity**: Correlated subqueries provide a straightforward way to reference columns from the outer query without the need for explicit joins.
* **Flexibility**: Correlated subqueries can be used in various scenarios, such as filtering, aggregating, or performing calculations based on related data.


## Considerations

* **Performance**: Correlated subqueries can be less efficient than non-correlated subqueries or joins, especially when dealing with large datasets. Careful indexing and query optimization may be necessary to improve performance.
* **Complexity**: Correlated subqueries can make SQL statements more complex and harder to understand, particularly when dealing with multiple levels of correlation or nesting.


## Conclusion

Correlated subqueries in MySQL are a powerful feature for referencing columns from the outer query within a subquery. Whether you need to filter, aggregate, or perform calculations based on related data, correlated subqueries provide a flexible and dynamic approach to querying your database. By understanding how to use correlated subqueries effectively, you can write more complex and precise MySQL queries to meet your specific requirements.
