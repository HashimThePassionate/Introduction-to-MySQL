## OVERVIEW

**Data Retrieval and Storage:**
- MySQL is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data. It allows users to create, modify, and query databases to manage large sets of 
  structured information.
- Data retrieval is the process of extracting information from a database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool commonly used 
  to retrieve data from relational databases.
- This documentation provides an overview of the data retrieval process with SQL, covering essential concepts and techniques.

## How its works!
 **Database Basics**
- `USE database_name`: Selects a database to work with.
- `SELECT FROM table_name`: Retrieves all columns and rows from a table.
- `SELECT specific_columns FROM table_name`: Fetches only specified columns.
- `WHERE clause`: Filters results based on certain conditions.
- `ORDER BY clause`: Sorts results in ascending or descending order.
- `DISTINCT keyword`: Eliminates duplicate rows.
